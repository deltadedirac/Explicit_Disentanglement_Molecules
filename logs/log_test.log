INFO:root:NOTE: remember, both inverse and direct transformation are made over the same original grid, not the
                normal configuration T(deformed_grid), because we are emulating the behavior of not having the historical information about
                the deformed grid (normaly when we transformed the new data, this is not possible). That's why we are using as a solution 
                just to make the interpolation strategy in inverse transforme just using the GP and for direct transform just using the linear
                interpolation
